## about the project
gentle. is an e-commerce application focused on fashion and lifestyle items mainly pertaining to plants and a cozy lifestyle. It's inspiration comes from my own sense of style as well as my main love, plants, with some art thrown in to create a cohesive feeling of warmth, coziness, and of course, gentleness.

The project was built using React, Tailwind CSS, MySQL, Node.js, and Express.js.

To run this project in your device, download the repository, open the terminal in the editor of your choice, and run:
```
npm start 
```
### development
Since this project is an updated version of a previous one, I started off by planning what I wanted to be different visually, so I immediately jumped in with a new color scheme and new logo. Afterwards, I got started with React and building all the components I would need for the screens I would be displaying. Once that was done, I built the server using Node and Express and got it to run. I then connected the products table I made in a MySQL databse to my application and got the information to display on the front-end. Last on the list was to create a working filter for the products, so I did that by creating a row of buttons that filter through the different categories of products.
